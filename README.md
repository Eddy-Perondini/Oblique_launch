# Oblique_launch
In this post, we are going to discuss about the oblique launch in classical mechanics physics using Python to observe the features that can be extracted and learn how to analyze this kind of physical system.

First of all, before any kind of mathematical interpretation, we need to understand what kind of physics we're dealing with, in order to elaborate our scientific discussion, and get into a response. The oblique launch begins with an object, which can be considered as a particle for pratical purposes, being launched with an angle $\theta$ relative to the ground. This particle is accelerated, having an initial velocity vector $\vec{v_{0}}$, which can be decomposed into two components $\vec{v_{0x}}$ and $\vec{v_{0y}}$ (for 2D motion). These two velocities works in two different ways, so this motion suggests two independent movements, in which creates the 2D oblique launch. The velocity in the $x$ axis is constant, which means that does not depend on time once the particle was launched. On the other hand, the velocity in the $y$ axis depends on time, and it has an influence of the gravitational potential of the Earth, adding up an acceleration term $\vec{g}$.

- **X Component**:
  $$\vec{v_{0x}} = v_{0} \cos \theta$$

- **Y Component**:
  $$\vec{v_{0y}} = v_{0} \sin \theta - g t$$
